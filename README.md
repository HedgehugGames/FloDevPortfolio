## 1. About Me

I am a 22-year-old programming student at the University of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt, in the Animation & Game department, with a keen interest in game development and a passion for tech art. I mainly work in Unity with C#, but I am also familiar with Unreal Engine and C++. Other programming languages I know include Java and Processing.  

Other applications I use: Blender (advanced), Maya (basic), Houdini (intermediate).

## 2. My Projects

### 🌿 Little Moth (Unreal – Older Project)

This project was created for my Bachelor project at Deutsche Pop in 2023 and is still in its prototype phase.

**What it is:**  
Little Moth is a short adventure game about a small forest spirit called Moth who travels through the forest to find his way home. To reach home, he helps other animals and discovers the secrets of the forest.

**My role:**  
As a solo project, I handled everything from coding the logic to modeling the characters, with a few exceptions (e.g., the turtle model).

**Highlights:**  
- Basic gameplay systems (Pickup Items, Quests, UI, Respawn, Companion)  
- Three different levels  
- Hand-painted style post-process shader  

**Link:**  
- Playable build: [Itch.io](https://hedgehuggames.itch.io/little-moth)

### 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Game (Unity)

This game was created as a solo semester project for h-da in the 2nd semester of 2025. It highlights specific game features and programming patterns. Later, it was extended to multiplayer, but due to time constraints, the single-player version is more polished, so this is the focus here.

**What it is:**  
An open-world adventure game where you find booze and treasue and battle enemies.

**My role:**  
All programming, using the Synty Pirate asset pack as a Basis.

**Highlights:**  
- Inventory system (pickup and use items)  
- State machine (State Pattern)  
- Boat sailing

### 🚕 Taxi Driver VR (Unity – Work in Progress)

My current semester project is a VR game in Unity, planned for completion by January 2026. It's a 4-person project, with me as the main programmer.

**What it is:**  
In this VR experience, you sit in a taxi with a mysterious driver who tells strangely familiar stories. As the ride continues, you slowly realize it’s your last journey.

**What’s done so far:**  
- Basic VR interaction (grab objects)  
- Basic taxi gameplay loop (grab objects → trigger next chapter → driver asks questions → player answers with voice → taxi halts to show memories)
- Dialogue Manager

**What’s coming next:**  
- More interactions: roll down windows, draw on fogged windows, control lights, radio music  
- Refined gameplay loop: scene changes after each chapter; show memories when taxi holds certain objects
